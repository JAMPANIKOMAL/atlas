# ATLAS v3 Development Log: 16S Pipeline Refinement

This document serves as a comprehensive log detailing the development process, strategic decisions, and technical challenges encountered while refining the 16S pipeline from its v2 prototype to its robust v3 implementation.

## 1. The Development Philosophy: Notebook-First

The entire refinement process was conducted using a "notebook-first" approach. Instead of modifying the production `.py` scripts directly, all development, debugging, and verification were performed interactively in Jupyter Notebooks (`01_Refining_16S_Preparation.ipynb` and `02_Refining_16S_Training.ipynb`).

**Rationale:** This methodology provided immediate visual feedback at every step, allowing for rapid identification of bugs and data issues. It ensured that the logic was sound and verified before being converted into the final, stable production scripts.

## 2. Key Strategic Decisions and Rationale

Several critical decisions were made to improve the robustness and performance of the pipeline.

### Decision: Increase Minimum Class Members from 2 to 3

**Initial State:** The v2 pipeline removed only "singleton" classes (genera with 1 member).

**Problem Encountered:** This led to a subtle but critical `ValueError` during the creation of the validation set. A class with only 2 members in the main training set could be split, leaving the new, smaller training set with a new singleton, which breaks the stratify function.

**Analysis:** We recognized this was a symptom of a "long-tail" distribution in biological data, where many classes are extremely rare. A model cannot learn meaningful patterns from only 2 examples; it can only memorize them, leading to poor generalization.

**Final Decision:** We increased the quality threshold, requiring a genus to have at least 3 members to be included in the dataset. This strategically discards a small amount of low-quality, unlearnable data to create a more stable and reliable training process, permanently solving the stratification errors.

### Decision: Maintain K-mer Size of 6

**Analysis:** We discussed the trade-off between k-mer size, specificity, and generality. A small k is too general, while a large k is too specific and can lead to the "curse of dimensionality."

**Final Decision:** k=6 was deemed an appropriate size for the 16S gene, providing a good balance. It is a well-established choice in bioinformatics for this marker.

### Decision: Continue Using the Sequential Keras Model

**Analysis:** We evaluated the Keras Sequential API versus the more complex Functional API.

**Final Decision:** Our problem is a straightforward, single-input, single-output classification task. The data flows through the network in a simple stack. The Sequential model is the cleanest, simplest, and most appropriate tool for this architecture.

## 3. Technical Challenges and Solutions

The interactive development process revealed several technical hurdles that were systematically solved.

### Challenge: GPU Not Detected

**Symptom:** The initial run of the training notebook showed TensorFlow was running on the CPU.

**Solution:** We diagnosed that the `cudatoolkit` and `cudnn` libraries, which are essential for TensorFlow to communicate with the NVIDIA driver, were missing from the Conda environment. The solution was to install the correct versions (`cudatoolkit=11.2`, `cudnn=8.1.0`) compatible with TensorFlow 2.10.

### Challenge: Kernel Crashes and Memory Exhaustion

**Symptom:** The Jupyter kernel would die unexpectedly, sometimes during training and sometimes immediately after.

**Diagnosis:** This was identified as a classic GPU memory (VRAM) exhaustion issue. The training process would fill the memory, and subsequent operations (like evaluation) would cause a crash.

**Solution:** A robust, professional post-training workflow was implemented. The final script now follows these steps:

1. Train the model.
2. Immediately save the trained model to a `.keras` file.
3. Explicitly clear the TensorFlow backend session (`tf.keras.backend.clear_session()`) and run Python's garbage collector (`gc.collect()`) to free up all GPU memory.
4. Load the saved model from the file into the now-clean memory space.
5. Perform the final evaluation.

This workflow is memory-safe and prevents kernel crashes.

### Challenge: Various NameError and ValueError Bugs

**Symptoms:** Throughout the notebook development, we encountered several `NameError` (e.g., 'Path' is not defined) and `ValueError` (related to stratification) bugs.

**Solution:** These were solved by adopting a more disciplined coding style. The final `.py` scripts ensure that all necessary modules are imported at the top and that data quality checks are performed at the correct stages, leading to a stable, error-free execution.

## 4. Final Outcome

The result of this refinement process is a pair of robust, heavily commented, and production-ready Python scripts. This workflow, born from interactive and iterative development, is significantly more reliable and well-understood than the original prototype.
