    "#   OBJECTIVE:\n",
    "#\n",
    "#       To develop the \"Explorer\" pipeline, the unsupervised learning component\n",
    "#       of ATLAS. This pipeline is responsible for processing sequences that\n",

    "#\n",
    "#       1.  Simulate Input: Create a sample FASTA file of \"unclassified\"\n",
    "#           sequences for development purposes.\n",
    "#       2.  Sequence Vectorization: Implement the Doc2Vec algorithm to convert\n",
    "#           raw DNA sequences into meaningful numerical vectors (embeddings).\n",
    "#           This involves creating a \"corpus\" of k-mers and training a model.\n",
    "#       3.  Clustering: Apply the HDBSCAN algorithm to the sequence vectors\n",
    "#           to group them into clusters of related organisms. HDBSCAN is\n",
    "#           chosen for its ability to handle noise and find clusters of\n",
    "#           varying shapes.\n",
    "#       4.  Interpretation: For each discovered cluster, select a representative\n",
    "#           sequence and (conceptually) outline how a BLAST search would be\n",
